# Flashcard App

This project is designed to test my ability to work with rendering and state management using React.

First get comfortable with:
```
Installing packages via NPM
Running tests from the command line
Writing React function components
Creating routes, including nested routes, using React Router
Using hooks like useState(), useParams(), and useHistory()
Debugging React code 
```

Rubric Followed creation of this app

```
All the props are treated as read-only.
State is never directly mutated; it's only updated via setState().
The Edit Card and Create Card screens share the same form component.
The useEffect() hooks have the appropriate dependencies listed in the dependency array.
State is "lifted up" to the parent component where appropriate.
All inputs are controlled.
```
